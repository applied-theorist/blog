This site is generated by Hugo and blogdown, hosted at Github, and continuously deployed via Netlify. 

In building this site, I found the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) really helpful. It is targeted at a novice like me. Besides, [this well-written post](https://www.alessandravalcarcel.com/blog/2018-03-15-r-rmarkdown-blogdown-basics/#push-changes-to-git) provides git commands that just work. I am certain that I will check the two resources again for my next hugo website. 


## Why blog?

I started to blog mainly inspired by other awesome bloggers, such as [Yihui](https://yihui.name/) and Terry Tao. Thanks to modern tools like Hugo, GitHub and Netlify, it is a breeze to make a static website to host articles. To write is to think. To think is to sharpen my old ideas, and generate new ideas during that process. I hope this website can force me to write and, more importantly, *think* more.
