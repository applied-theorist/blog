This site is generated by Hugo and blogdown, and continuously deployed via GitHub and Netlify. The blog theme is [Ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy). Many features are copied from the [original author's site](https://yihui.name/), based on which I made the following changes.    

## How and why I tweaked the original theme 

1. Comment system

    I use [utterances](https://github.com/utterance), which is based on GitHub. To leave comments, you need a GitHub account.
    I choose utterances because the configuration is easy and [well-documented](https://utteranc.es/?installation_id=1242991&setup_action=install). 

1. Fonts

    It is a pain to read the default fonts (Palatino and Georgia) on my Windows PC. I changed the default body fonts to Source Serif Pro. For Chinese readers using Windows, it is strongly recommended to install [Source Serif Han](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/type/pdfs/download-guide-source-han.pdf#page=5), which has already bundled the Source Serif Pro fonts. 

1. Navigation menu

    The original menu is overcomplicated for me. So I manually crafted the [present menu](https://github.com/AlbertLei/blog-theorist/blob/master/layouts/partials/simple_menu.html) by raw html.
	
I was new to HTML/CSS. It took me about three whole days to generate and deploy this blog. Currently I am satisfied with the appearance and have decided not to change it in the near future. 

In building this site, I found the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) really helpful. It is targeted at a novice like me. Besides, [this well-written post](https://www.alessandravalcarcel.com/blog/2018-03-15-r-rmarkdown-blogdown-basics/#push-changes-to-git) provides git commands that just work. Now I simply use the following batch script to push commits to GitHub.

```bash
cd C:\blog-hugo\blog-theorist
git add -A
set /p Input=What revisions? 
git commit -m "%Input%"
git push
```     	

## Why blog?

I started to blog mainly inspired by the awesome bloggers [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/) and [Qiaochu Yuan](https://qchu.wordpress.com/). Thanks to modern tools like Hugo, GitHub and Netlify, it is a breeze to make a static website to host my articles. To write is to think. To think is to sharpen my old ideas, and generate new ideas during that process. I hope this website can force me to write and, more important, *think* more.
