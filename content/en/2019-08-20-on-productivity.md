Inefficiency troubled me. After being a full-time researcher who wrote papers to make a living, I found I had stayed up more often. That would not be a problem if it is a burning night. However, they are usually of low efficiency or even worse, simply procrastination. For those reasons, I found it necessary to do some research about GTD (Getting Things Done) methods. Besides, the tentative solution to procrastination below is to a great degree inspired by this [well-informed blog.](https://guzey.com/productivity/)

## What if I am being inefficient?

Usually I procrastinate at the office. If I feel like I am procrastinating, either of the following remedies might help depending on the present time.

### If it is still around lunch

1. Be chill.

1. Go for walk/jogging or lunch. Think about the cause of procrastination. Usually it is due to some seemingly thorny problem or something I have no control of.

1. If after walk/jogging/lunch I still can not get away with the obstacle, accept it. I may talk to others about it. Or simply try to work on other things.

### If it is already after dinner

1. Set an early home-coming time. When the time comes, go home. Remember to put everything for work in the backpack.

1. Go home. Maybe do some cleaning if it is early.

1. Be chill. Set an early alarm for tomorrow. Sleep.

1. When I wake up, grab the backpack and do NOT take the phone.

1. Go to the library or cafe. Start working without the phone.     

## To be continued

I would test these remedies in practice and perhaps add some case studies later.
