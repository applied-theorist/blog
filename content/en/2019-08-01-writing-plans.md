> Revised on Sep 2019.

I plan to work on the following topics for future posts. Nowadays most posts^[Like [this](/cn/2019/07/travel/), [this](/cn/2019/08/democracy-in-america/) and [this](/cn/2019/01/bourgain/)... Oh boy I definitely should write more in languages other than Chinese.] are inspired by random daily events and thoughts. This might not be a bad thing as I have always enjoyed improvisational performances. However, sometimes I may not have any idea but still want to write something.^[Because writing actually [generates ideas](/en/2019/07/blog-setup/#why-blog).] Then I may consider the following stuff to blog about.   


## Writing plans

1. Math
    - Collect some old math notes into blogs.
	- I would write new stuff, or simply borrow from old materials like *advanced calculus* or *algebra* notes.
	- Hopefully make a gitbook at last. The ideal is something like the [Napkin book.](https://github.com/vEnhance/napkin/)

1. Economics
	- Bayesian persuasion related papers, 
	- dynamic mechanism design related papers,
	- and (axioms-based) behavioral economics. 
	
1. Language learning
	- Language learning experience and notes like French, German, and Haskell... 
	- Read and write about [*How to Learn a Foreign Language.*](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Foreign-Language-Pimsleur-Ph-D-ebook/dp/B00DX0F2XO)

1. Philosophy
    - Read _Convention: A Philosophical Study_ and write a review. [Convention](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/convention/) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
	
1. Music
	- I should definitely finish the book review of *What to Listen for in Music.*	
	- Attend choir rehearsals more. Okay that is not really about blogging.
