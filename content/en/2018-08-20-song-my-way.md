*My Way* is the song I wish to be played at my funeral.  On condition that I would have lived my life honorably as the lyrics sing.

You can hear on Youtube [the version by Frank Sinatra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E2hYDIFDIU), who also have performed two other my beloved songs ([*New York, New York*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btFfXgUdIzY) and [*Fly Me To The Moon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2rDb4Ur2dw)). 

## Lyrics

> And now, <br>
> the end is near. <br>
> An’ so I face <br>
> the final curtain. <br>
> My~ friend, <br>
> I’ll say it clear. <br>
> I’ll state my case, <br>
> o[f] which I’m certain.

> I’ve lived <br>
> a life that’s full. <br>
> I’ve traveled each, <br>
> and every highway. <br>
> And more, <br>
> much more than this, <br>
> I did it my way. <br>

> Regrets, <br>
> I’ve had a few. <br>
> But then again, <br>
> too few to mention. <br>
> I did, <br>
> what I had to do. <br>
> Saw it through,^[_See something through_: persist with an undertaking until it is completed.] <br>
> without exemptions. 


> I planned <br>
> each charted course <br>
> each careful step <br>
> on the byway. <br>
> An’ more, <br>
> much more than this, <br>
> I did it my way. 
>
> *[Chorus]*
>
> Yes there were times. <br>
> I’m sure you knew. <br>
> When I bit off <br>
> more than I could chew.^[_Bit off more than he can chew:_ do something too difficult for him.] <br>

> But through it all, <br>
> when there was doubt. <br>
> I ate it up, <br>
> and spit it out.^[_Spit it out:_ say or confess something quickly.] <br>
> I faced it all. <br>
> And I stood tall. <br>
> And did it my way. <br>


> For what is a man, <br>
> what has he got? <br>
> If not himself, <br>
> then he has not <br>
> to say the words <br>
> he truly feels; <br>
> And not the words <br>
> of one who kneels. <br>
> The record shows <br>
> I took the blows^[*Take the blows:* accept and withstand a shock.]–-- <br>
> And did it in my way.
