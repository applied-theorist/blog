Hey there, what's up. 
This is the place where I write and babble under the pen name _Theorist._ Specifically,

- I mainly write in [English](/en/) and [中文](/cn/).

- The [home page](/) (or by clicking the Bear-Bull image in the navigation menu) lists all articles in the reverse chronological order. 

- You can help me edit each page, including this one, by clicking the "Edit this page on GitHub" at the bottom.^[This is a cool feature, and [easily implemented](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pull/6) if the source files are hosted online. You may also check [the blog set-up](/en/2019/07/blog-setup/) if you are interested.]

- You can subscribe [via RSS](/index.xml). In case you want to contact me, comment at [the repo issus.](https://github.com/applied-theorist/blog/issues)  

That's it. Happy reading.
